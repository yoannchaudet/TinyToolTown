# Tiny Tool Town 🏘️

A delightful showcase for **free, fun & open source tiny tools**.

> *"Vibe coding is the GeoCities of the AI era."*

## What is this?

Tiny Tool Town is a community-driven directory of small, delightful, open-source tools. The kind of tools that are stupid and delightful — made for an audience of one, built over a weekend, and probably wouldn't cost more than a buck or two.

## AI Summary Generator

A .NET 10 CLI tool in `tools/TinyToolSummarizer/` that uses the [GitHub Copilot SDK](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/hello-copilot-sdk-dotnet) to auto-generate fun AI summaries and key features for every tool in the directory.

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK supporting `net10.0`
- [Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-github-copilot-in-the-command-line) installed and authenticated (or `GH_TOKEN` env var with Copilot Requests permission)
- `GH_TOKEN` is also recommended for higher GitHub API rate limits when fetching READMEs

### Usage

```bash
cd tools/TinyToolSummarizer
dotnet run
```

**Interactive mode** gives you three options:
1. Only process tools without AI summaries (default)
2. Re-run on ALL tools (overwrite existing)
3. Pick a specific tool

**Headless mode** for CI/automation:

```bash
dotnet run -- --headless              # New tools only
dotnet run -- --headless --all        # Re-generate all
dotnet run -- --headless --tool name  # Specific tool (without .md)
```

The tool fetches each tool's GitHub README, sends it to Copilot, and writes `ai_summary` and `ai_features` into the markdown frontmatter. The website renders these automatically on each tool's detail page.
