        <blockquote>
          "Vibe coding is the GeoCities of the AI era."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Remember GeoCities? That glorious, chaotic, beautiful mess of personal websites?
          Everyone had one. Most of them were terrible. <strong>All of them were wonderful.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          We're living in that moment again. AI tools have made it possible for anyone to build software.
          People are creating tiny, weird, wonderful tools — not because there's a market for them,
          but because they <em>want them to exist</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Tiny Tool Town</strong> is a place to celebrate those creations.
        </p>

        <h2>What belongs here?</h2>

        <p>
          Tools that are <strong>free, fun, and open source</strong>. The kind of thing you'd build
          for yourself on a Saturday afternoon. The kind of thing you'd show your friends and they'd say
          "that's stupid" and then immediately ask for the link.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>🔧 <strong>Tiny</strong> — Does one thing, does it well</li>
          <li>✨ <strong>Delightful</strong> — Makes you smile</li>
          <li>🆓 <strong>Free</strong> — Open source, free to use</li>
          <li>❤️ <strong>Made with love</strong> — Built because someone cared</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What doesn't belong here?</h2>

        <p>
          Enterprise SaaS products. Paid tools with "free tiers." Anything with a pricing page.
          This isn't Product Hunt. This is the neighborhood.
        </p>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>

        <p>
          Tiny Tool Town is powered entirely by GitHub. The site is static — no servers, no databases,
          no auth. Every tool listing is a markdown file in
          <a href="https://github.com/shanselman/TinyToolTown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the repository</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Want to add your tool? <a href="/submit/">Submit a pull request</a>. It's that simple.
          The community reviews it, and your tool gets a little house in the town. 🏠
        </p>

        <h2>Who made this?</h2>

        <p>
          Tiny Tool Town was created by
          <a href="https://hanselman.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott Hanselman</a>
          after a conversation with
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@hankgreen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hank Green</a>
          about vibe coding, the spirit of GeoCities, and the joy of making things just because you can.
        </p>

        <p>
          Built with <a href="https://astro.build" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro</a>,
          hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Pages</a>,
          and maintained by the community. ✨
