Textream is a free, open-source teleprompter app with three guidance modes: real-time word tracking, classic auto-scroll, and voice-activated scrolling. It displays an elegant Dynamic Island overlay at the top of your screen — or as a floating window, or fullscreen on a Sidecar iPad. Invisible to your audience, always visible to you.
