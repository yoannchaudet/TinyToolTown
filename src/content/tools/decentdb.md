DecentDB is a embedded relational database engine focused on durable writes, fast reads, and predictable correctness. I created it thinking me and my AI friends could make something close to SQLite speed, turns out we did! Then I created native binding in a couple of languages and then made a DecentDB.MicroOrm and published to NuGet.org. Not terrible indeed.
