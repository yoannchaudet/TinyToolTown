Smaug automatically fetches your Twitter/X bookmarks (and optionally likes), then uses AI to analyze and categorize each one into clean, searchable markdown files. I built it because Twitter bookmarks are where good ideas go to die — Smaug rescues them. It works with Claude Code or OpenCode for multi-model flexibility, runs on a simple `npx smaug run` command, and includes a setup wizard so you're archiving in under 5 minutes. It's delightful because it turns your chaotic bookmark graveyard into an organized, searchable knowledge base.
