You're sitting down with your closest bunch of friends and talking over some food and beverages. It is very likely that you use words & phrases that an evesdropper, not part of your circle, will struggle to understand. But everyone breaks into a laughter roit in your group because those words, those phrase means something to all of you. And that knowledge is something that's been built on the inside for years together. 

I think that these words, phrases deserve the poise that words get on Websters, Dictionary.com and the like. 

We need a way, to define our nonsense. Not because it is nonsense, but because it is ours. 

Defn is the way I thought to solve that problem.
