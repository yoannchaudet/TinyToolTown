Built using [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli) for the [GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge](https://dev.to/leereilly/dev-tartan-deterministic-plaid-from-a-github-username-101m). Started to build this on a train from Glasgow to Neilston in Scotland after hearing people talking about their clan tartans. Sounded like a splendid idea at the time!
