This tool takes a single Tableau workbook, or a directory of workbooks, and assesses each workbook based on its complexity. Useful for planning a migration away from Tableau, looking for anti-patterns in your workbooks, or just for fun! Outputs include json, csv, or a local html page in a nicely formatted report view.
