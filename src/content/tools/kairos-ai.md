**KaiROS AI** is a powerful open-source local AI assistant for Windows and Android that enables you to run large language models (LLMs entirely on your own device) without any cloud dependency, prioritizing privacy and offline use. It offers a full chat interface with model management, document retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), streaming responses, GPU acceleration support (CUDA/DirectML/Vulkan), and even a local REST API for developers to integrate locally hosted models into other applications.
