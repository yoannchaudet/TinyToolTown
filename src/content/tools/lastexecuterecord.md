There are many ways to install applications, like winget, npm install, volta, or dotnet tool update. But it’s hard to know when to run them, and it’s annoying to run the commands every time. With this tool, I can run them regularly based on the last time they were executed. I can also choose not to run them when I’m on a metered connection.
