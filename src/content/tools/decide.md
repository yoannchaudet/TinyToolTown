Ever been stuck in the [Paradox of Choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice), where you have so many things to choose from that you just… can't?

Decide breaks that nut, based on a simple technique me and my family have been using for quite some time: only picking between two things.
