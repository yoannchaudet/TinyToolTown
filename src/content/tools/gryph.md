Gryph is a local-first audit trail for AI coding agents. It hooks into your agents, logs every action to a local SQLite database, and gives you powerful querying capabilities to understand, review, and debug agent activity.

**Why Gryph?**

- Transparency - See exactly what files were read, written, and what commands were run
- Audit Trail - See exactly what your AI coding agent did
- Debugging - Replay sessions to understand what went wrong
- Privacy - All data stays local. No cloud, no telemetry
