I built Ambie in 2020 during covid lockdowns to help me relax an de-stress while being stuck indoors. It's evolved since to become a useful little tool to help people focus and relax. A lot of folks enjoy Ambie for being open source, functional offline, and simple to use. It also runs on Xbox consoles! While there is a premium tier, it's only for some optional content. The app is fully functional without premium, and the app is ad-free.
