User Authentication: Secure login with bcrypt password hashing
Asset Tracking: Add monthly income and expense entries manually
Data Visualization: Interactive charts showing asset progression, income vs expenses, and expense categories
Advanced Filtering: Filter entries by date range, transaction type, and categories
Sortable Columns: Click table headers to sort by any column
Data Management: Edit and delete existing entries
Encrypted Storage: All data encrypted at rest using AES-256-CBC
