An Open-Source, Schema-Driven Rendering Engine for LLM-Generated Documents
VizuLLM turns structured LLM outputs into real, deterministic documents and visual artifacts.
Instead of asking an LLM to write text, VizuLLM enables LLMs to generate data for a document type, which is then rendered reliably using a strict schema contract.
This makes LLM-powered systems predictable, printable, and production-ready.
