This tool displays recommendations for a user that is stored in their GitHub profile as a public gist. It is triggered by submitting "npx pub-recs &lt;username&gt;". I built it because I realized it's likely that one might receive recommendations in multiple locations so it would be nice to centralize the and make them accessible. It's delightful because it fits in a developers toolset very nicely
