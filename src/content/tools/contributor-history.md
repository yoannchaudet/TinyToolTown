Contributor History is the missing growth chart for GitHub — like star-history.com (https://star-history.com), but instead of stars it tracks contributors!

Paste in any repo (or a few) and instantly see how their contributor base grew over time, with timeline alignment for fair comparisons and a sketch mode for fun. It's 100% client-side, no backend needed, and charts are one click away from your README.
