Podcast Metadata Generator turns a podcast transcript into publish-ready metadata: multiple title ideas, short/medium/long descriptions, YouTube-style chapters with timestamps, and SRT subtitles. Built to remove the tedious post-production writing step and make it fast (and fun) to go from transcript to assets. Ships as a simple dotnet tool and includes a local-only Blazor demo UI.
