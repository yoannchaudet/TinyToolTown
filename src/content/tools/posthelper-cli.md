PostHelper CLI helps you rewrite and polish tweets and social posts using AI powered by the GitHub Copilot SDK. It includes a friendly interactive terminal UI, supports multiple tones (Professional, Friendly, Hype), emoji levels, and platform-aware character limits (Twitter, Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads, LinkedIn, etc.). It’s delightful because you can run it as a simple .NET tool (`post-helper`), pipe text in/out, copy results to your clipboard, and even draft posts from a URL with a content preview.
