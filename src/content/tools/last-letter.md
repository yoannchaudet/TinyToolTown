It's a game, like hangman, where players can guess words. I built it for my son as we enjoy playing hangman together and it's a good way to learn spelling and phonics, but we're not always able to play together at the same time. Hangman, as a concept, is pretty gruesome, so there are other ways for the attempts to be registered visually. 

It brings us both joy and I hope it brings other people joy too.
