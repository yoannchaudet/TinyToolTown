RackPeek is a lightweight, opinionated dotnet CLI tool & Blazor WebApp for documenting and managing home lab and small-scale IT infrastructure.

It helps you track hardware, services, networks, and their relationships in a clear, scriptable, and reusable way without enterprise bloat or proprietary lock-in.
