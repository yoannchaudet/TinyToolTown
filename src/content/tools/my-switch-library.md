My Switch Library is a Progressive Web App for tracking your Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 game collection across physical and digital titles. You can search games (via TheGamesDB), add manual entries, switch between grid/list views, and share and compare libraries with friends. It’s delightful because it’s installable as a PWA, works offline (with a localStorage fallback), and adds fun extras like trending games and theme support.
