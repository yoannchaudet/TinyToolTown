GridWiggle makes it super easy to create great-looking photo collages on mobile or desktop - just upload as many photos as you want and click shuffle to see different layout options. Photos with people in them are auto-cropped, but you can manually edit the crop on any photo you want. Mark one or two photos as "hero" to have them be larger in the layout. Save it as a PNG.

I made this app because it drives me nuts to use any other photo collage app on the market that I've tried, because they try to get me to pay a subscription fee to get access to stickers and different templates, or they require soooooo much manual futzing around to get photos cropped and laid out in a clean grid without any big gaps.
