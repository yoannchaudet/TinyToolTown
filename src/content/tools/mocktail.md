Mocktail solves the “I need a backend right now” problem. It’s a tiny, Docker-ready mock server that lets you create REST API endpoints, return any response, add delays, and watch live traffic through a built-in request inspector.

I built it to remove friction in frontend development and demos where real services aren’t available. It’s especially demo-friendly — you can shape exact responses and make your presentation work in your favour even when the real backend isn’t ready. Real-time logs, code snippet generation, faker-based data randomization, advanced JSON modification tools, and persistent storage make it more than a JSON stub — it’s a complete mock API workflow.

Upcoming MCP server support will allow AI tools to generate JSON that respects your database schema and existing API structure, keeping mocks realistic and aligned with your data model.
