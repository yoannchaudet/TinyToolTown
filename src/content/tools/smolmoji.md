This app started because I wanted to make a custom emoji for a discord I run with some friends from college. I couldn't find any existing emoji to represent the topic we wanted an emoji for on any of the usual sites ("successfully adulting, like doing the laundry"), so I decided to make this app to build my own. It ended up being pretty handy not just for emoji but for favico/app icons for other things I've built.
