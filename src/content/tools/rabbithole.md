*rabbithole* is a terminal UI for consuming and inspecting `RabbitMQ` messages in real time. It features a topology browser for exploring exchanges and bindings, a split-pane consumer view with vim-style navigation, dynamic protobuf decoding that auto-detects message types from routing keys, and optional SQLite persistence for saving message history across sessions. Built with Bubble Tea and designed for developers who live in the terminal.
