**Lazydotnet** is a Terminal User Interface (TUI) designed to streamline the workflow for .NET developers who live in the CLI.

**What it does:** It provides an interactive dashboard to explore solution structures, manage NuGet packages, execute tests, and launch projects. It wraps standard `dotnet` commands into a snappy, keyboard-driven interface.

**Why I built it:** I love the speed and focus of terminal tools like lazygit, but I found myself constantly context-switching or typing out verbose `dotnet` commands for simple tasks. I wanted a tool that brought the visual hierarchy of an IDE to the speed of the terminal.

**Why it's delightful:** It reduces friction. You can navigate complex solutions and run specific tests without touching a mouse. It makes the .NET CLI feel modern, fast, and surprisingly cozy.
